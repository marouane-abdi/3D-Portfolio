# 3D Portfolio

Welcome to my 3D Portfolio built with React and powered by Vite for an incredibly fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). This project is set up with a minimal configuration to showcase my 3D models and projects using React Three Fiber, which brings 3D rendering capabilities to the React ecosystem.

## Features

- React for building user interfaces in a declarative way with efficient update and rendering.
- Vite as the build tool, providing an extremely fast development environment with HMR.
- React Three Fiber for incorporating 3D models into a React application.
- ESLint for maintaining code quality with predefined rules.

## Plugins

This project uses two official plugins for a smooth developer experience:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Leverages Babel for Fast Refresh and optimized development builds.
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: Utilizes SWC as a super-fast TypeScript/JavaScript compiler for Fast Refresh.

## Quick Start
